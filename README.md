# GreenTips
## Inspiration
As extreme weather and other unusual conditions become more and more frequent, it is urgent for us to pay more attention to the topic of environmental protection. Thus, we developed this app to help people become more aware of the importance of recycling and sustainability, and do our part to preserve our surroundings.
## What it does
This App has 3 features.
1. It contains a reminder page which let users enter ideas and tips that will help protect the environment, in the form of sticky notes, with aesthetic colors.
2. It has an interactive, informative page which displays the 6 kinds of common garbage, providing information on how they should be disposed of.
3. It allows users to enter their contact information, so that we can communicate with them to discuss further information on recycling. (Currently we do not collect that information.)
## How we built it
We primarily used Figma for drafting our layout, Android Studio for developing the app, and Github for version control.
## Challenges we ran into
This is our first time developing an Android app, so we encountered many problems but were able to overcome most of them. Sometimes, the Android Studio malfunctioned, and we had a hard time trying to pull out the emulator. We also messed around with LinearLayout and RelativeLayout, and waste some time achieving our expected layout.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are so proud that we managed to develop an android app, with useful features and nice layout which resembles mainstream mobile apps, in a timely manner. We managed to add views both statically and dynamically during runtime. We also stored user data into the app's internal preferences files.
## What we learned
We learned Android Studio from scratch, and learned how to add views from XML files and directly from JAVA files. We also learned a bit about adb, the android debug bridge.
## What's next for Green Tips
We will be implementing the feature of collecting user's contact infomation so that we can contact them afterwards, if time permits. We will also add system notification to the reminder part of the app, so that users can be notified in real time about their todos.
